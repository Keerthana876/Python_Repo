learning python from basics
covered concepts like 
to connect local repository with remote repository we can give our credentials to it 
(git config --global user.name "keerthana",git config --global user.email "keerthanareddy337@gmail.com"
1)git status --> untracked,tracked(unmodified,modified,staging)
2)git add . -->to add working space files to staging area
3)git add filename--> to add particular filename to the staging area
4)git commit -m "my first file is added to the staging area which is moved to unmodified state"--> inline commit
5)git commit --> vi editor will be open we can enter our commit message in it --> after entering commit message we can close it by using :wq
6)git clone url --> to clone remote repository 
7)git init --> to create new local repository or to reintialize local repository
8)git push origin master --> to push my local repo master changes to the remote repo(directly changes will be merged to remote repo
9)git push origin keerthana --> to push changes from my local repo branch (keerthana) to the remote repo(keerthana) branch --> after that merge option 
will be displayed to merge the changes
10)git pull origin master --> changes from remote repository are merged to the local repository branch
11)git fetch origin --> changes from remote repo are copied to .git file 
12)git merge master --> changes copied to .git file are merged to selected branch
13git stash--> if we want to delete some files from repo we storing those files in stash area ,we want to use them then we can apply the changes from stash to repo
14)git stash apply --> latest changes stored in the stash are applied to my repo
15)git stash drop --> changes applied to the repo are not completly deleted we have to drop the changes after applying
16)git stash pop --> instead of using 2 commands directly we can use pop to apply the changes and drop the changes
17)git branch --> display branch names 
18)git branch new_branch_name --> command to create new branch
19)git checkout new_branch_name --> to move to new_branch_name
20)git checkout -b new_branch --> instead of using 2 commands directly we can create branch and move to specific branch
21)git -d new_branch --> to delete the new_branch
22)git log --> to get commits details
23)git log --oneline --graph --all --> will display commit in single line ,graphing display ,all commits will be displayed
24)git log -p --> display commits and changesin them

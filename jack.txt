3)-->how to use stash in git 
to use stash command then it will be applicable on staging area files
command to use stash --> git stash

-->how to retrived stash files

if we use stash apply command then it will copy the lastest stash file(python.py) in to local repository
to remove the(python.py)file from the stash list we can drop the stash--> git stash drop then that file is drop from the stash area

-->we can use git stash pop stash{0} from stash list 
particular file can be retrived by using above command
